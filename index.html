<h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE :</h2>
<article><p><b>AI & Cybernetics</b> is an interdisciplinary program which provides expertise in Robotics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Machine Perception, etc. The next industrial revolution will be application of artificial intelligence in various fields of engineering. Cybernetics was introduced in early 40s as <b>the study of human/machine interaction</b> guided by the <b>principle of feedback, control, and communications</b>. Intelligent control, effective perception and decision making are major pillars of this discipline which indicates the relevance of this program in today’s world. The students will get exposure to sophisticated computer algorithms and various robotics applications through this project-based curriculum crafted by experts.

The program B.Tech ECE <b>(Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics)</b> is specially designed that aims to give an in-depth knowledge of intelligence as well as intelligent systems may be artificial and/or biological. We try to provide our students especially with persistent, long-term knowledge of cutting-edge topics which also includes up-to-date research findings. We believe that graduates with such knowledge can easily find their jobs in both academia and industry. With the partnerships with industries and research groups around the globe we allow the students to work in ongoing research projects. We believe that excellent research positively influences the quality of education. Students will be prepared for creative application of basic as well as advanced intelligent techniques in all major areas of engineering.
Humans are always ahead of machines and that is the main reason we are trying to give human level intelligence to machines. Artificial intelligence otherwise also called machine intelligence impart human ability to make decisions and learning from examples to machines. Though autonomous machines are available from long before, but decision-making power and perception of environment are provided by artificial intelligence. AI has now applications in almost all areas starting from finance to healthcare domains.

Robotics is another area which can be considered as a mix of various domains. High end applications require AI to impart intelligence to it whereas some applications may only require some rule-based systems. Modern era has seen that inflection points in society always create opportunities. COVID 19 increases the opportunities of online education. Rise of smartphones with GPS was the turning point which enabled Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and many other services. Artificial intelligence and machine learning is now capable of transforming many industries.
</p> <p>Education technology facilitates the learning process and improves the quality of education. Over the last decade, the education domain has shifted from teacher-centric to learner-centric, and now to collaborative and active learning. Furthermore, information technology has progressed from stand-alone computing systems to distributed computing systems, and now to automotive computing systems. In the form of Educational Technology, combining the areas of education and information technology affects the learning environment, teaching approaches, student learning, and corporate operations.

Teachers can use educational software and technology to make their classes more interesting and enriching. Teachers can employ technology to imitate real-world learning opportunities and provide students with access to research materials. Technology also aids education access, particularly as schools struggle to adapt to remote learning in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Increased smartphone usage and a shift to digital-learning paradigms have accelerated this trend.

Both Covid 19 and Industry 4.0 have revolutionized the educational system. This degree program prepares educators how to use technology effectively in the classroom. Curriculum supervisors and instructional coaches can use this degree to help instructors learn how to use new technology effectively. Educators’ expertise is needed in many areas, including the development of online learning platforms and new software solutions for the education business.

In 2021, AI and Machine Learning are expected to have a 47 percent increase in influence in Educational Technology. The capacity of these technologies to automate even the most fundamental functions, such as grading, communication, inquiries, feedback, evaluation, and progress, enhances the entire user experience. Learning will become more dynamic in the future. The future of education would be hybrid, multilingual, and personalized. This paradigm shift demands the graduate as an educational specialist in order to work as an educational consultant, solution architect, or edutect developer. Academic credit banks and learning autonomy are emphasized in the National Education Policy (NEP). This opens up a number of possibilities for digital solutions.
